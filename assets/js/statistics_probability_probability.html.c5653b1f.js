If something has a probability of 0, it will never happen. If it has a probability of 1, it will definitely happen.</p><p><strong>Everyday examples:</strong></p><ul><li>Flipping a coin: 50% chance of heads, 50% chance of tails</li><li>Rolling a dice: Each number has a 1/6 chance (about 17%)</li><li>Rain tomorrow: Weather says 30% chance of rain</li><li>Getting a red card from a deck: 26 out of 52 cards are red, so 50% chance</li></ul><p><strong>How we use it:</strong> Probability helps us make decisions when we&#39;re not sure what will happen. Like:</p><ul><li>Should I bring an umbrella? (depends on chance of rain)</li><li>Is this investment risky? (what&#39;s the probability of losing money?)</li><li>Will my team win? (based on past performance and current conditions)</li></ul><p><strong>Simple ways to think about it:</strong></p><ul><li>If you did the same thing 100 times, probability tells you roughly how many times each outcome would happen</li><li>Higher probability = more likely to happen</li><li>Lower probability = less likely to happen</li></ul><p><strong>Where it comes from:</strong> We calculate probability by looking at:</p><ul><li>How many ways something can happen</li><li>How many total possible outcomes there are</li><li>Past data (like how often it rained in March over the last 10 years)</li></ul><p>Probability basically helps us deal with uncertainty by putting numbers on our best guesses about what might happen.</p>',12)])])}]]),s=JSON.parse('{"path":"/statistics/probability/probability.html","title":"Probability","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"headers":[],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"vedicskill","username":"vedicskill","email":"vedicskill@gmail.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/vedicskill"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"94d30ae1a9470866a374afdff154bf78e2442788","time":1757346560000,"email":"vedicskill@gmail.com","author":"vedicskill","message":"Merge pull request #8 from vedicskill/develop"}]},"filePathRelative":"statistics/probability/probability.md"}')}}]);
